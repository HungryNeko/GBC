### STEPSï¼š  
before use, please clone the repository 3D Gaussian Splatting:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jonstephens85/gaussian-splatting-Windows.git
```
, or just use the package we provide in the gaussian-splatting-Windows.
then, 
```sh
git clone https://github.com/jantic/DeOldify.git
```
After that, put the videocolorize.py to under the package of **DeOldify**.
Now, you can use the **how2run.txt**'s command to run the **run.bat** to process the whole project.
